## Custom Configuraton

These values can be configured in your user settings config.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `vscode-codeception.commandSuffix` | string | `null` | Flags or arguments to be appended to the command run. E.g if you want to add `--debug` this is the correct place. |
| `vscode-codeception.codeceptBinary` | string | `null` | A custom path of the Codecept binary. By default it will be auto-discovered from the `vendor` folder. |

### How to use these values

Open your settings (or Workspace settings), switch to JSON and put them like this:

```
{
    "vscode-codeception.commandSuffix": null,
    "vscode-codeception.codeceptBinary": null,
}
```

## Roadmap: what's next?

This extension is still under heavy development, and will be updated regulary.

This is what I plan to implement:

- Panel on left sidebar to see suites and available tests
- Re-run failures
